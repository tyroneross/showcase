# /showcase — Router

Route this request to the appropriate showcase subcommand or skill based on the user's intent.

**Raw user input**: $ARGUMENTS

## Routing logic

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or only whitespace: list the available subcommands below and ask the user what they want to do.
2. Otherwise: match the user's natural-language request against the subcommand intents below and invoke the best match.
3. If the request clearly doesn't fit any subcommand but matches a `showcase` skill (listed in your available skills), load the skill and follow its guidance instead.
4. If nothing fits, say so and list the subcommands. Do NOT guess.

## Available subcommands

- **`/showcase:capture`** — Take a screenshot of a URL, app window, or simulator
- **`/showcase:export`** — Export captures to an output directory with markdown manifest
- **`/showcase:find`** — Search captures by tags, feature, date, or free text
- **`/showcase:gallery`** — Overview of all captures grouped by feature, date, component, or platform
- **`/showcase:record`** — Record a short video clip (5-30s)
- **`/showcase:status`** — Library stats — total captures, by type, storage size
- **`/showcase:tag`** — Add/remove tags, update title, feature, component, or star a capture
- **`/showcase:walkthrough`** — Record an interactive walkthrough with scripted steps


## Examples

- User types `/showcase` alone → list subcommands, ask for direction
- User types `/showcase <free-form request>` → match intent, invoke subcommand
- User types `/showcase:<specific>` → bypass this router entirely (direct invocation)

## Rules

- Prefer the most specific subcommand match. If two could fit, ask which.
- Never invent a new subcommand. Only route to ones listed above.
- If the user is describing a workflow that spans multiple subcommands, outline the sequence and ask whether to proceed.
